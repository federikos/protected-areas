# GraphQL Server Example

This example shows how to implement a **GraphQL server with TypeScript** with the following stack:

- [**Apollo Server**](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server): HTTP server for GraphQL APIs   
- [**GraphQL Nexus**](https://nexusjs.org/docs/): GraphQL schema definition and resolver implementation 
- [**Prisma Client**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client): Databases access (ORM)                  
- [**Prisma Migrate**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate): Database migrations               
- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/): Relational database

## Getting started

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

### 2. Create and seed the database

Create a new postgres database.

Rename .env.example file to .env, replace DATABASE_URL.

For PostgreSQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
"postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=SCHEMA"
```

Use the following command to create tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

When `npx prisma migrate dev` is executed against a newly created database, seeding is also triggered. The seed file in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) will be executed and your database will be populated with the sample data.


### 3. Start the GraphQL server

Launch your GraphQL server with this command:

```
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser to explore the API of your GraphQL server in a [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

### 4. Interact with data

You can interact with your Data with full CRUD functionality with

```
npx prisma studio
```


## Switch to another database (e.g. MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB)

If you want to try this example with another database than SQLite, you can adjust the the database connection in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma) by reconfiguring the `datasource` block. 

Learn more about the different connection configurations in the [docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/database-reference/connection-urls).

<details><summary>Expand for an overview of example configurations with different databases</summary>

### MySQL

For MySQL, the connection URL has the following structure:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE"
}
```

Here is an example connection string with a local MySQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = "mysql://janedoe:mypassword@localhost:3306/notesapi"
}
```

### Microsoft SQL Server

Here is an example connection string with a local Microsoft SQL Server database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "sqlserver"
  url      = "sqlserver://localhost:1433;initial catalog=sample;user=sa;password=mypassword;"
}
```

### MongoDB

Here is an example connection string with a local MongoDB database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "mongodb"
  url      = "mongodb://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST/DATABASE?authSource=admin&retryWrites=true&w=majority"
}
```
Because MongoDB is currently in [Preview](https://www.prisma.io/docs/about/releases#preview), you need to specify the `previewFeatures` on your `generator` block:

```
generator client {
  provider        = "prisma-client-js"
  previewFeatures = ["mongodb"]
}
```
